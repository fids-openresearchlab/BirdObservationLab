# Contributing

Do you want to help with the development of BirdObservationLab? We have some ideas on how to do it:

## Bug reporting

Something isn't working and you followed instructions in the documentation? Make sure you are using the latest available version and if the problem persists, open an issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/fids-openresearchlab/BirdObservationLab/issues) to let us know.

## Requesting new features

You can use the options provided in {ref}`Getting Support` to suggest new features you want to see in new releases of the BirdObservationLab.

## Extending BirdObservationLab source code

If you want to contribute directly to the project (improve documentation, implement new features or fix existing bugs) you can make a pull request and we will analyze it as soon as possible.
